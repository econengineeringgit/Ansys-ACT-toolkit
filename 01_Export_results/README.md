# Export result as text file

In this example two different approaches are presented to export raw result using python from Mechanical result object.

- In the [simple_export.py](simple_export.py) the `ExportToTextFile` method of the result object is used
- in the [detailed_export.py](detailed_export.py) the `PlotData` is extracted and written to a text file after some formatting.
